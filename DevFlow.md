### Future fixes/features
- Play logs and connection status | config
- Cater for shaky connections. Currently, if connection gets lost,
  there are socketio errors
- Game save feature (save board state and player rack, everything). Currently, if player refreshes his/her browser, the whole game has to be restarted


## Possible bugs
- Update scoring to add other players' scores to the player's whose rack was emptied
- In-rack drag on not turn
